Smith, M.D.\\nDESCRIPTION OF PROCEDURE: Under adequate general anesthesia an incision was\\nmade in the old operative scar located in the right inguinal area through the skin and\\nsubcutaneous tissues. The external oblique was identified. The cord was identified and\\nseparated free from a large direct sac posteriorly, separated free to the inguinal wall. This\\nwas imbricated. A large Marlex plug was inserted, sutured in place to the posterior wall\\ninterrupted sutures of 2-O Vicryl. The patient was asked to cough, there was no evidence\\nof any weakness. Above this there was a pantaloon type hernia adjacent to the cord, there\\nwas a small lipoma that was resected, submitted to pathology. Another plug was inserted\\nadjacent to the cord which was snug. The plug was inserted, sutured to the internal crus\\nwith interrupted suture of 2-0 Vicryl, the patient asked to cough, no evidence of any\\nweakness. A segment of Marlex mesh was inserted over the cord, sutured in place above\\nthe cord and laid over the posterior inguinal canal, sutured in place with 2-0 Vicryl. The\\npatient was asked to cough, no evidence of any weakness. The cord was allow to lie over\\nthe new bed. The ilioinguinal nerve was identified on the left and preserved. The\\nexternal oblique approximated with 2-0 Vicryl, subcutaneous tissue approximated with\\n2-0 plain and skin approximated with skin clips. Sponge, instrument and needle count\\ncorrect.\\nJeff T.
