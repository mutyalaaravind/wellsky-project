“Over the past 5 days, how often have you limited your participation in rehabilitation therapy sessions due to pain? This includes any therapy sessions you have had, or any exercises you have done as prescribed by your therapists”.  

Therapy at the rehab center was painful sometimes. Most of the walking therapy I had to do hurt, and so did the leg exercises on my right leg.”  

“Over the past 5 days, how often have you limited your day-to-day activities (excluding rehabilitation therapy sessions) because of pain?” 

Quite a bit, it is hard for me to get to the bathroom and stuff while walking, but I don’t hurt all the time.  

Mamie also describes her pain to be sharp with bending her right knee at times while going to sit to stand or walking.  She reports the throbbing can be annoying, but the ibuprofen she takes really helps, as well as the icing routine the therapists taught her at rehab.  She said her pain is better by ‘leaps and bound’s than it was right after the fall.  She has chronic low back pain, that she is used to at this point. She does routine back stretches which help, but she is stiff and achy in the morning. She rates her static pain on the Comparative pain scale at a 3/10 and a 4/10 with movement.
